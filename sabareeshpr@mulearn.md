### About Me

> I'm a Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in both UI/UX design and development. I enjoy combining creativity and function—whether it's designing user-friendly interfaces or building the systems behind them. With experience in graphic design and a love for visual storytelling, I enjoy working in teams and learning new things.
